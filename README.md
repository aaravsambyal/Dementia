# Dementia

AI Early-Stage Dementia Detector

> A prototype AI tool to assist in early detection of dementia from multimodal inputs (speech, short cognitive tests, handwriting/drawing samples, and optional imaging).
Not a medical device — for research / screening assistance only. Always consult clinicians for diagnosis.

TL;DR

This project implements an explainable AI pipeline that produces a risk score and interpretable signals suggesting whether a subject may be showing early cognitive impairment consistent with dementia. It’s intended for research and screening workflows (e.g., memory clinics, longitudinal studies, caregiver tools), not for standalone diagnosis.
